    "In this notebook, we'll be looking at how to apply deep learning techniques to the task of sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis can be thought of as the exercise of taking a sentence, paragraph, document, or any piece of natural language, and determining whether that text's emotional tone is positive, negative or neutral. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will go through the general steps involved with all machine learning problems. Also, it will cover numerous topics like word vectors, recurrent neural networks, and long short-term memory units (LSTMs). Don't get discouraged if you don't get a full understanding of what these terms mean at the first go. There will be links provided for additional reading on these topics.\n",

    "Natural language processing is all about creating systems that process or “understand” language in order to perform certain tasks. These tasks could include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Question Answering - The main job of technologies like Siri, Alexa, and Cortana\n",
    "* Sentiment Analysis - Determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text\n",
    "* Image to Text Mappings - Generating a caption for an input image\n",

    "In the pre-deep learning era, NLP was a thriving field that saw lots of different advancements. However, in all of the successes in the aforementioned tasks, one needed to do a lot of data transformations and feature engineering (e.g. stopwords, stemming, part-of-speech tags, etc.) and thus had to have a lot of domain knowledge in linguistics. Entire 4 year degrees are devoted to this field of study, as practitioners needed to be comfortable with terms like phonemes and morphemes. In the past few years, deep learning has seen incredible progress and has largely removed the requirement of strong domain knowledge. As a result of the lower barrier to entry, applications to NLP tasks have been one of the biggest areas of deep learning research. "

    "From the context of the sentences, we can see that both words are generally used in sentences with positive connotations and generally precede nouns or noun phrases. This is an indication that both words have something in common and can possibly be synonyms. Context is also very important when considering grammatical structure in sentences. Most sentences will follow traditional paradigms of having verbs follow nouns, adjectives precede nouns, and so on. For this reason, the model is more likely to position nouns in the same general area as other nouns. The model takes in a large dataset of sentences (English Wikipedia for example) and outputs vectors for each unique word in the corpus. The output of a Word2Vec model is called an embedding matrix.\n",

    "This embedding matrix will contain vectors for every distinct word in the training corpus. Traditionally, embedding matrices can contain over 3 million word vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Word2Vec model is trained by taking each sentence in the dataset, sliding a window of fixed size over it, and trying to predict the center word of the window, given the other words. Using a loss function and optimization procedure, the model generates vectors for each unique word. The specifics of this training procedure can get a little complicated, so we’re going to skip over the details for now, but the main takeaway here is that inputs into any Deep Learning approach to an NLP task will likely have word vectors as input.\n",

    "Now that we have our vectors, our first step is taking an input sentence and then constructing the its vector representation. Recall that we capped the length of each review at 250 words. If we convert each word directly into it's 50-D vector representation (as shoen in the output of the cell above), each review will be represented as a 250 x 50. However, this isn't the most efficient use of memory since we're keeping duplicates of a word vector every time the word occurs in our corpus. Luckily, Tensorflow (and many other deep learnign frameworks) realizes this, provides a embedding lookup function built in so that we can simple transform each word into the *index* of the word in the embedding matrix.\n",

This function takes in two arguments, one for the embedding matrix (the wordVectors matrix in our case), and one for the ids of each of the words. The ids vector can be thought of as the integerized representation of the training set. This is basically just the row index of each of the words. Let's look at a quick example to make this concrete.

From a purist's perspective, the testing set should be used once and only once to report the accuracy of the model you have chosen to put into production. If there are multiple models being experimented with, you should compare their accuracy levels with the _validation_ set. Once you have used your testign set to compare the accuracy of multiple models, you are effectively changing it into a validation set. The reason behind this is to avoid overfitting. We will not go into the details here so just remember to set aside data for testing and do not use it until you ahve chosen which model to put into production"

If we have time, we can revisit this later. For the time being, just think of RNNs as a type of machine learning algorithm suited for time series or sequence data. For sentiment analysis with movie reviews, RNNs will not only look at the current word in the review when training and making predictions, but also words that appeared earlier in the review. LSTMs are mechanisms within RNNs that control how much importance to place on the current vs. previous words (or how much of the previous words to remember, hence the term \"memory\" units)."

For simplicity sake, we won't go into the specific formulations for each gate, but it's worth noting that each of these gates can be thought of as different modules within the LSTM that each have different functions. The input gate determines how much emphasis to put on each of the inputs, the forget gate determines the information that we'll throw away, and the output gate determines the final h<sub>t</sub> based on the intermediate states. For more information on understanding the functions of the different gates and the full equations, check out Christopher Olah's great [blog post](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/).\n",

The LSTM units would then be able to realize that any sentence without numbers will likely not have an impact on the answer to the question, and thus the unit will be able to utilize its forget gate to discard the unnecessary information about the dog, and rather keep the information regarding the numbers.

Learning rate becomes extremely important since we don't want our weight values to fluctuate wildly as a result of a large learning rate, nor do we want a slow training process due to a low learning rate. The default value of 0.001 is a good place to start. You should increase this value if the training loss is changing very slowly, and decrease if the loss is unstable.  \n",

    "Looking at the training curves above, it seems that the model's training is going well. The loss is decreasing steadily, and the accuracy is approaching 100 percent. However, when analyzing training curves, we should also pay special attention to the possibility of our model overfitting the training dataset. Overfitting is a common phenomenon in machine learning where a model becomes so fit to the training data that it loses the ability to generalize to the test set. This means that training a network until you achieve 0 training loss might not be the best way to get an accurate model that performs well on data it has never seen before. Early stopping is an intuitive technique commonly used with LSTM networks to combat this issue. The basic idea is that we train the model on our training set, while also measuring its performance on the test set every now and again. Once the test error stops its steady decrease and begins to increase instead, you'll know to stop training, since this is a sign that the network has begun to overfit. "
